ULMTCS-2#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits require reduction  
This design uses 1661 control sets (vs. available limit of 8150, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 15 percent. This is at a level where reduction is REQUIRED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 504 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
